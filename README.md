The application inlcudes three public APIs - IEX Cloud, Open weather API and a Jokes API, all accessible in one place. It was built using Node, Handlebars, and bootstrap.To view stocks enter a stock name, to view the weather enter the name of a city and press the "press for jokes" button repeatedly for various random jokes.
